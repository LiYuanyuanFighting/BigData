When I run lab2 with parameter passed through command line, I always had NullPointerException, after  
asking professor, got the reason:  
In configuration, I first wrote:  
'Job job = Job.getInstance(conf)'   
then   
conf.set("BeginWord", args[2]); // To set parameter  
Obviously, it is too late to set parameter at that time, because the job has already used  
the old conf...  

I always have the problem with connecting to the gateway through FileZilla:  
host: sftp://localhost
Username: root  Password: root Port:2122  
So have to use the command:
scp -P 2122 document.txt root@localhost  
Then transfered the file document.txt to docker

**questions from lab2**  
What is the size of your input dataset, compared to the simple word counts (1足grams)? Did 
you need the cluster to filter the 1足grams? What about the 2足grams (or the n足grams for the n 
of your choice)?
--A cluster is a group of servers and other resources that act like a single system and enable  
high availability and, in some cases, load balancing and parallel processing. (A Hadoop cluster  
is a special type of computational cluster designed specifically for storing and analyzing huge  
amounts of unstructured data in a distributed computing environment.)  
So for small amount data to process, there is no need to use the cluster

To match the first several characters can use:

import java.util.regex.Pattern;
import java.util.regex.Matcher;

public class MatcherExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String text    =
            "This is the text to be searched " +
            "for occurrences of the http:// pattern.";

        String patternString = ".*http://.*";

        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(patternString);

        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(text);
        boolean matches = matcher.matches();
    }
}

First a Pattern instance is created from a regular expression, and from the Pattern instance    
a Matcher instance is created. Then the matches() method is called on the Matcher instance.   
The matches() returns true if the regular expression matches the text, and false if not.
